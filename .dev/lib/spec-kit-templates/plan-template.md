## Context

Based on this specification:

```
{{SPECIFICATION}}
```

Create a detailed technical implementation plan.

## Technical Approach

### Architecture

Describe the technical architecture:

- What components/modules are needed?
- How do they interact?
- What patterns will be used?

### Technology Stack

Specify technologies to use:

- Languages:
- Frameworks:
- Libraries:
- Tools:

### Data Model

If applicable, describe data structures:

- Database schema changes
- API contracts
- Data flows

## Implementation Steps

Break down into sequential phases:

### Phase 1: [Foundation]

**Goal:**
**Tasks:**

1. Task 1
2. Task 2
3. Task 3

**Estimated time:** X hours/days

### Phase 2: [Core Implementation]

**Goal:**
**Tasks:**

1. Task 1
2. Task 2
3. Task 3

**Estimated time:** X hours/days

### Phase 3: [Integration & Polish]

**Goal:**
**Tasks:**

1. Task 1
2. Task 2
3. Task 3

**Estimated time:** X hours/days

## File Changes

What files will be created/modified:

**New files:**

- `path/to/new/file.js` - Purpose

**Modified files:**

- `path/to/existing/file.js` - Changes needed

## Testing Strategy

How will this be tested:

- Unit tests for...
- Integration tests for...
- Manual testing steps...

## Risk Assessment

Potential challenges and mitigation:

| Risk   | Impact          | Mitigation     |
| ------ | --------------- | -------------- |
| Risk 1 | High/Medium/Low | How to address |
| Risk 2 | High/Medium/Low | How to address |

## Rollback Plan

If things go wrong:

1. Step to revert
2. Step to revert
3. Step to revert

## Dependencies

External dependencies needed:

- Library X version Y
- Service Z configuration
- API keys or credentials

## Deployment

How will this be deployed:

1. Deployment step 1
2. Deployment step 2
3. Verification step

**Instructions to LLM:**
Replace {{SPECIFICATION}} with the actual spec content, then create a detailed, actionable technical plan. Be specific about file changes, code structure, and implementation approach. Focus on HOW to build it.
