## Project Context

**Product**: {{PROJECT_NAME}}
**Description**: {{PROJECT_DESCRIPTION}}
**Primary Users**: {{PRIMARY_USERS}}
**Core Value**: {{CORE_VALUE}}

This brief contains a ready-to-use prompt for Google Nano Banana (Gemini 2.5 Flash Image) to generate multiple visual concept explorations for your product's user interface.

## üçå Google Nano Banana Prompt

Copy the prompt below and paste it into Google AI Studio to generate visual concepts:

```
You are Google Nano Banana (Gemini 2.5 Flash Image). Generate 3 distinct visual concepts for {{PROJECT_NAME}}, a {{PROJECT_DESCRIPTION}} serving {{PRIMARY_USERS}}.

For each concept, render a cohesive storyboard of four mobile-first screens:
1. Search screen for {{SEARCH_GOAL}}
2. Write/Compose screen for {{WRITE_GOAL}}
3. Sign Up screen highlighting {{SIGNUP_VALUE}}
4. Sign In screen emphasizing {{SIGNIN_SECURITY}}

Creative constraints:
- Brand cues: {{BRAND_PALETTE}}, {{TYPOGRAPHY}}, {{ILLUSTRATION_STYLE}}
- Tone: {{EXPERIENCE_TONE}} (ensure consistency across all screens)
- Layout guidance: use {{LAYOUT_PRINCIPLES}} with clear hierarchy, accessible contrast, and prominent primary actions
- Include placeholder copy reflecting {{VOICE_GUIDELINES}}; avoid lorem ipsum
- Maintain component consistency so UI kits can be extracted (buttons, form fields, nav bars, empty states)

Output instructions:
- Deliver each concept as a 4-frame grid (aspect ratio 4:5 per frame) with labels per screen
- Keep backgrounds clean; no watermarks
- After rendering, summarize the differentiators for each concept so stakeholders can pick one

If any required context is missing, assume sensible defaults for a modern SaaS productivity tool and provide helpful clarifying questions.

## How to Use This Prompt

### Step 1: Access Google AI Studio

1. Visit https://aistudio.google.com/
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click "Create new chat" or open an existing chat

### Step 2: Run the Prompt

1. **Copy the entire prompt** from the code block above
2. **Paste it into the chat** in Google AI Studio
3. Ensure the model is set to **Gemini 2.5 Flash** (or latest Flash Image model)
4. **Send the message** and wait for Nano Banana to generate concepts

### Step 3: Review Generated Concepts

Google Nano Banana will generate:

- **3 distinct visual concepts** (each representing a different design direction)
- **4 screens per concept** (Search, Write/Compose, Sign Up, Sign In)
- **A summary of differentiators** for each concept to help you choose

Review each concept for:

- Visual appeal and brand alignment
- Information hierarchy and clarity
- Component consistency across screens
- Accessibility (contrast, readability)
- Scalability for additional features

### Step 4: Save Your Chosen Concept

1. **Screenshot or download** the concept images you prefer
2. Save them to `docs/ui/concepts/` in your project (create folder if needed)
3. **Name the concept** something memorable (e.g., "Clean Professional", "Vibrant Energy")

### Step 5: Log Your Selection

After choosing a concept, record your decision:

**Option A - Using Agilai Agent**:

```bash
# In your Agilai chat session
@nano-banana-liaison
*log-nano-selection
```

**Option B - Manual Documentation**:
Create or update `docs/ui/nano-banana-explorations.md` with:

- Chosen concept name and visual characteristics
- Why you selected it over alternatives
- Asset file paths
- Implementation notes for the dev team

---

## What Happens Next

Once you've logged your concept selection:

‚úÖ **Architecture Phase** - The frontend architecture will reference your chosen visual direction
‚úÖ **UX Specifications** - Design decisions will inform component and layout specifications
‚úÖ **Development Stories** - Implementation tasks will mention the selected visual style
‚úÖ **Design Handoff** - Your team has a clear visual foundation to build from

---

## Expected Outputs

You should receive **3 visual concept sets**, each containing:

1. **Search Screen**: Shows how users discover/browse content
2. **Write/Compose Screen**: Shows how users create or input new data
3. **Sign Up Screen**: Shows onboarding flow highlighting key value proposition
4. **Sign In Screen**: Shows returning user authentication with security emphasis

Each concept will have:

- Consistent color palette across all 4 screens
- Unified typography and visual style
- Clear component patterns (buttons, forms, navigation)
- Realistic placeholder copy (not lorem ipsum)
- Mobile-first layout optimized for 4:5 aspect ratio

---

## Tips for Success

üéØ **Review with stakeholders** - Visual concepts are most valuable when reviewed collaboratively
üéØ **Consider brand alignment** - Choose concepts that reinforce your brand values
üéØ **Think about scalability** - Select concepts with component systems that can grow
üéØ **Document your decision** - Recording _why_ you chose a concept prevents future misalignment
üéØ **Use as a starting point** - These concepts inform design, not replace detailed mockups

**Instructions to LLM:**
Replace all {{PLACEHOLDER}} values with actual project context from the user request, PRD, or specification:

- {{PROJECT_NAME}}: Product/project name
- {{PROJECT_DESCRIPTION}}: One-sentence product description
- {{PRIMARY_USERS}}: Main user persona or user type
- {{CORE_VALUE}}: Primary benefit or value proposition
- {{SEARCH_GOAL}}: What users search/browse for
- {{WRITE_GOAL}}: What users create/compose
- {{SIGNUP_VALUE}}: Key benefit highlighted during signup
- {{SIGNIN_SECURITY}}: Security/trust elements for signin
- {{BRAND_PALETTE}}: Colors/hex codes (infer from context or use sensible defaults)
- {{TYPOGRAPHY}}: Font style direction (e.g., "modern sans-serif")
- {{ILLUSTRATION_STYLE}}: Visual treatment (e.g., "flat with subtle gradients")
- {{EXPERIENCE_TONE}}: Overall feeling (e.g., "professional yet approachable")
- {{LAYOUT_PRINCIPLES}}: Structural approach (e.g., "card-based with generous whitespace")
- {{VOICE_GUIDELINES}}: Copy tone (e.g., "concise and action-oriented")

If any context is missing, infer sensible defaults for a modern SaaS productivity application.
