## Next Steps

1. **Copy each prompt** from the code blocks above
2. **Visit Google AI Studio**: https://aistudio.google.com
3. **Create new chat** with Gemini 2.5 Flash (or latest Flash Image model)
4. **Paste prompt** for each screen
5. **Review generated concepts** - you'll get 3 concept variations per screen
6. **Select your favorite direction** across all screens
7. **Log your selection**: Activate `@ui-designer-liaison` and run `*log-selection`

## Using Google Nano Banana (Gemini 2.5 Flash Image)

### What You'll Get

For each screen prompt, Google Nano Banana will generate:

- **3 distinct visual concepts** with different design approaches
- **Mobile-first artboards** (4:5 aspect ratio)
- **Multiple states** (default, loading, error/empty)
- **Consistent brand application** across all concepts

### How to Use

1. **Open Google AI Studio**: Navigate to https://aistudio.google.com
2. **Select Model**: Choose "Gemini 2.5 Flash" or the latest Flash Image model
3. **Copy & Paste**: Copy the entire prompt for one screen (from the code block above)
4. **Generate**: Send the prompt and wait for concepts to generate
5. **Review**: Evaluate the 3 concept variations for visual appeal, clarity, and brand fit
6. **Repeat**: Do this for each screen in your journey
7. **Select**: Choose your preferred concept direction (can be different elements from different concepts)

### Tips for Better Results

- **Save all concepts**: Download or screenshot all variations before moving to the next screen
- **Stay consistent**: Pick a visual direction and stick with it across all screens
- **Focus on hierarchy**: Look for clear information architecture and user flow
- **Check accessibility**: Ensure sufficient contrast and readable text sizes
- **Think scalability**: Consider how the design system will grow

## Logging Your Selection

Once you've generated concepts and selected your preferred direction:

### Option 1: Using UI Designer Liaison (Recommended)

```bash
@ui-designer-liaison
*log-selection
```

The liaison will guide you through recording:

- Which concept you chose (e.g., "Concept 2")
- Visual characteristics (colors, typography, layout)
- Key differentiators (why this concept over others)
- Asset locations (where you saved the images)
- Implementation guidance (notes for developers)

### Option 2: Manual Documentation

Create `docs/ui/ui-designer-explorations.md` with:

- Concept name and description
- Visual characteristics
- Journey steps covered
- Asset references
- Decision rationale
