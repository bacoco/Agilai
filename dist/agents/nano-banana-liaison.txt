# Web Agent Bundle Instructions

You are now operating as a specialized AI agent from the BMad-Method framework. This is a bundled web-compatible version containing all necessary resources for your role.

## Important Instructions

1. **Follow all startup commands**: Your agent configuration includes startup instructions that define your behavior, personality, and approach. These MUST be followed exactly.

2. **Resource Navigation**: This bundle contains all resources you need. Resources are marked with tags like:

- `==================== START: .aidesigner-core/folder/filename.md ====================`
- `==================== END: .aidesigner-core/folder/filename.md ====================`

When you need to reference a resource mentioned in your instructions:

- Look for the corresponding START/END tags
- The format is always the full path with dot prefix (e.g., `.aidesigner-core/personas/analyst.md`, `.aidesigner-core/tasks/create-story.md`)
- If a section is specified (e.g., `{root}/tasks/create-story.md#section-name`), navigate to that section within the file

**Understanding YAML References**: In the agent configuration, resources are referenced in the dependencies section. For example:

```yaml
dependencies:
  utils:
    - template-format
  tasks:
    - create-story
```

These references map directly to bundle sections:

- `utils: template-format` ‚Üí Look for `==================== START: .aidesigner-core/utils/template-format.md ====================`

# Create Document from Template (YAML Driven)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL EXECUTION NOTICE ‚ö†Ô∏è

**THIS IS AN EXECUTABLE WORKFLOW - NOT REFERENCE MATERIAL**

When this task is invoked:

1. **DISABLE ALL EFFICIENCY OPTIMIZATIONS** - This workflow requires full user interaction
2. **MANDATORY STEP-BY-STEP EXECUTION** - Each section must be processed sequentially with user feedback
3. **ELICITATION IS REQUIRED** - When `elicit: true`, you MUST use the 1-9 format and wait for user response
4. **NO SHORTCUTS ALLOWED** - Complete documents cannot be created without following this workflow

**VIOLATION INDICATOR:** If you create a complete document without user interaction, you have violated this workflow.

## Critical: Template Discovery

If a YAML Template has not been provided, list all templates from .aidesigner-core/templates or ask the user to provide another.

## CRITICAL: Mandatory Elicitation Format

**When `elicit: true`, this is a HARD STOP requiring user interaction:**

**YOU MUST:**

1. Present section content
2. Provide detailed rationale (explain trade-offs, assumptions, decisions made)
3. **STOP and present numbered options 1-9:**
   - **Option 1:** Always "Proceed to next section"
   - **Options 2-9:** Select 8 methods from data/elicitation-methods
   - End with: "Select 1-9 or just type your question/feedback:"
4. **WAIT FOR USER RESPONSE** - Do not proceed until user selects option or provides feedback

**WORKFLOW VIOLATION:** Creating content for elicit=true sections without user interaction violates this task.

**NEVER ask yes/no questions or use any other format.**

## Processing Flow

1. **Parse YAML template** - Load template metadata and sections
2. **Set preferences** - Show current mode (Interactive), confirm output file
3. **Process each section:**
   - Skip if condition unmet
   - Check agent permissions (owner/editors) - note if section is restricted to specific agents
   - Draft content using section instruction
   - Present content + detailed rationale
   - **IF elicit: true** ‚Üí MANDATORY 1-9 options format
   - Save to file if possible
4. **Continue until complete**

## Detailed Rationale Requirements

When presenting section content, ALWAYS include rationale that explains:

- Trade-offs and choices made (what was chosen over alternatives and why)
- Key assumptions made during drafting
- Interesting or questionable decisions that need user attention
- Areas that might need validation

## Elicitation Results Flow

After user selects elicitation method (2-9):

1. Execute method from data/elicitation-methods
2. Present results with insights
3. Offer options:
   - **1. Apply changes and update section**
   - **2. Return to elicitation menu**
   - **3. Ask any questions or engage further with this elicitation**

## Agent Permissions

When processing sections with agent permission fields:

- **owner**: Note which agent role initially creates/populates the section
- **editors**: List agent roles allowed to modify the section
- **readonly**: Mark sections that cannot be modified after creation

**For sections with restricted access:**

- Include a note in the generated document indicating the responsible agent
- Example: "_(This section is owned by dev-agent and can only be modified by dev-agent)_"

## YOLO Mode

User can type `#yolo` to toggle to YOLO mode (process all sections at once).

## CRITICAL REMINDERS

**‚ùå NEVER:**

- Ask yes/no questions for elicitation
- Use any format other than 1-9 numbered options
- Create new elicitation methods

**‚úÖ ALWAYS:**

- Use exact 1-9 format when elicit: true
- Select options 2-9 from data/elicitation-methods only
- Provide detailed rationale explaining decisions
- End with "Select 1-9 or just type your question/feedback:"

# Generate Google Nano Banana Prompt Task

## Purpose

To generate a comprehensive, context-rich prompt for Google Nano Banana (Gemini 2.5 Flash Image) that will produce multiple cohesive visual concept explorations for your product's user interface. This task bridges project requirements and AI-powered visual ideation.

## Inputs

- Completed Product Requirements Document (`docs/prd.md`)
- Completed UI/UX Specification (`docs/front-end-spec.md`) - if available
- Project context (name, descriptor, target personas, value propositions)

## Key Activities & Instructions

### 1. Understanding Google Nano Banana

Google Nano Banana (Gemini 2.5 Flash Image) is a multimodal AI model specifically designed to generate visual content based on detailed textual descriptions. Unlike code generation tools (v0, Lovable), Nano Banana creates **visual concept explorations** that help teams:

- Explore multiple visual directions before committing to one
- Align stakeholders on design aesthetic and layout principles
- Accelerate the design phase with AI-powered ideation
- Capture design intent early in the process

### 2. Core Prompting Principles for Visual AI

Before assembling the prompt, understand these principles for effective visual AI generation:

- **Rich Context Creates Rich Visuals**: Provide detailed project background, user personas, and value propositions
- **Specific Constraints Drive Quality**: Define brand palette, typography, layout principles, and tone explicitly
- **Multiple Concepts Enable Choice**: Request 3-5 distinct visual directions to give stakeholders real options
- **Consistency Validates Concepts**: Ask for multiple screens per concept to verify visual coherence
- **Mobile-First Reveals Truth**: Mobile screens expose layout and hierarchy decisions more clearly than desktop

### 3. Context Gathering Workflow

Walk through the following context gathering steps before presenting the final prompt:

#### Step 3.1: Product Foundation

Gather from PRD and project brief:

- **Product Name**: What is the product called?
- **Product Descriptor**: One-sentence description (e.g., "a collaborative task management tool")
- **Primary Persona**: Who is the main user? (e.g., "remote team managers")
- **Core Value Proposition**: What's the #1 benefit users get?

#### Step 3.2: Key User Scenarios

Identify 3-4 critical user actions that should be visualized. For a complete concept exploration, select screens that represent:

1. **Search/Browse**: How users find or discover content
2. **Create/Compose**: How users input or create something new
3. **Sign Up**: How new users onboard (highlight value prop)
4. **Sign In**: How returning users access the product (emphasize security/trust)

For each scenario, note:

- **Goal**: What is the user trying to accomplish?
- **Key elements**: What must be visible on this screen?

#### Step 3.3: Brand & Visual Direction

Gather from UX spec or elicit if missing:

- **Brand Palette**: Primary colors, accent colors (hex codes if available)
- **Typography Preference**: Modern, classic, playful, technical?
- **Illustration Style**: Flat, gradient, 3D, minimal, hand-drawn?
- **Experience Tone**: Professional, friendly, energetic, calming, trustworthy?

#### Step 3.4: Layout & Interaction Principles

Define structural guidelines:

- **Layout Principles**: Grid-based, asymmetric, card-based, list-based?
- **Hierarchy Approach**: Bold headings, visual weight, color coding?
- **Primary Action Style**: Prominent buttons, floating actions, inline actions?
- **Accessibility Requirements**: Contrast ratios, touch target sizes?

#### Step 3.5: Voice & Copy Guidelines

How should UI copy sound?

- **Voice Characteristics**: Concise, conversational, technical, encouraging?
- **Copy Length**: Minimal labels vs descriptive text?
- **Instructional Tone**: Direct commands vs gentle suggestions?

### 4. Assembling the Nano Banana Prompt

Once context is gathered, assemble the prompt using the canonical template from `templates/nano-banana-prompt.md`. The template includes placeholders for:

**Product Context:**

- `{{product_name}}`: Product name
- `{{product_descriptor}}`: One-line description
- `{{primary_persona}}`: Main user type
- `{{concept_variations}}`: Number of concepts (recommend 3-4)

**Scenario Details:**

- `{{search_goal}}`: What users search/browse for
- `{{write_goal}}`: What users create/compose
- `{{signup_value_prop}}`: Key benefit shown during signup
- `{{signin_security_needs}}`: Trust/security elements for signin

**Brand & Visual:**

- `{{brand_palette}}`: Colors (hex codes)
- `{{typography}}`: Font style direction
- `{{illustration_style}}`: Visual style
- `{{experience_tone}}`: Overall feeling

**Layout & Copy:**

- `{{layout_principles}}`: Structural approach
- `{{voice_guidelines}}`: Copy tone and style

### 5. Present the Prompt and Usage Instructions

After assembling the prompt:

1. **Display the Complete Prompt**: Show the fully populated prompt in a code block for easy copying
2. **Explain the Structure**: Briefly note what makes this prompt effective (context, constraints, specific outputs)
3. **Provide Google AI Studio Instructions**:
   - Visit https://aistudio.google.com/
   - Create a new chat with Gemini 2.5 Flash
   - Paste the prompt
   - Review the generated concept sets
   - Export or screenshot the concepts you want to explore further
4. **Set Expectations**:
   - Nano Banana will generate 4-screen storyboards for each concept variation
   - Concepts will be visually distinct to enable meaningful choice
   - Each concept maintains internal consistency
   - Generated images are starting points for discussion and refinement
5. **Next Steps Guidance**:
   - Review concepts with stakeholders
   - Select one concept as the primary direction
   - Run the `*log-nano-selection` command to record the choice
   - The logged decision will inform architecture and development phases

### 6. Document Creation

Use the `create-doc.md` task to write the prompt brief to `docs/ui/nano-banana-brief.md` with:

- Project context summary
- The complete prompt (in a code block)
- Usage instructions for Google AI Studio
- Expected outputs description
- Next steps (logging selection)

## Important Notes

- **No Mock Data**: Use real project details from PRD and specs; never invent placeholder information
- **Mobile-First Always**: All screen specifications should start with mobile layout
- **Consistency Over Cleverness**: Request coherent design systems, not disparate screen experiments
- **User Review Required**: All AI-generated concepts require human review and selection before proceeding
- **Decision Capture Essential**: The value comes from logging the chosen direction for downstream phases

## Output Artifact

`docs/ui/nano-banana-brief.md` containing:

1. Project context
2. Ready-to-use Nano Banana prompt
3. Google AI Studio instructions
4. Expected outputs and next steps

# Record Nano Banana Selection Task

## Purpose

To capture the chosen Google Nano Banana visual concept exploration and persist the design decision for downstream architecture, UX specifications, and development phases. This task bridges AI-powered ideation and implementation by documenting which visual direction was selected and why.

## Prerequisites

- User has run the Nano Banana prompt in Google AI Studio
- User has received multiple concept variations (typically 3-4)
- User has reviewed concepts with stakeholders (if applicable)
- User has selected one concept as the primary visual direction

## Key Activities & Instructions

### 1. Elicit Concept Selection Details

Ask the user to provide the following information about their selected concept. Be conversational but thorough:

#### 1.1 Basic Selection Information

- **Concept Identifier**: Which concept did you choose? (e.g., "Concept 2", "Option B", "The gradient-based design")
- **Concept Name/Label**: Give it a memorable name for team reference (e.g., "Clean Professional", "Vibrant Energy", "Minimal Trust")

#### 1.2 Visual Characteristics

Capture the defining visual elements of the chosen concept:

- **Color Palette**: What are the primary colors used? (hex codes if available)
- **Typography Style**: How would you describe the typography? (modern, classic, bold, elegant, etc.)
- **Layout Approach**: What's the overall layout structure? (card-based, list-based, grid, asymmetric, etc.)
- **Visual Style**: What's the illustration/visual treatment? (flat, gradient, 3D, minimal, hand-drawn, photographic, etc.)
- **Overall Aesthetic**: Sum up the feeling in 2-3 adjectives (e.g., "professional, trustworthy, efficient")

#### 1.3 Key Differentiators

Ask: "What made you choose this concept over the others?"
Capture 2-4 specific reasons, such as:

- Better alignment with brand values
- Clearer information hierarchy
- More accessible contrast/readability
- Stronger visual differentiation
- Better user flow clarity
- More scalable component system

#### 1.4 Asset References

Gather links or references to the generated assets:

- **Generated Images**: URLs, file paths, or screenshot locations
- **Storage Location**: Where are these assets saved? (e.g., Figma, Google Drive, project repo)
- **Frame/File Names**: Specific identifiers for each screen in the concept set

Example: "All 4 screens saved to `docs/ui/concepts/clean-professional/*.png`"

#### 1.5 Implementation Guidance

Ask: "What should the development team know about implementing this concept?"
Capture any important notes:

- Component consistency requirements (e.g., "Use the same button style across all screens")
- Accessibility considerations (e.g., "Maintain 4.5:1 contrast ratio for all text")
- Animation/interaction hints (e.g., "Cards should have subtle hover lift effect")
- Responsive adaptation notes (e.g., "On desktop, show sidebar navigation instead of bottom nav")

### 2. Create Exploration Log Entry

Use the `create-doc.md` task to append to `docs/ui/nano-banana-explorations.md` (create if doesn't exist).

If this is the first entry, create the document with:

```markdown
# Google Nano Banana Concept Explorations

This document tracks visual concept explorations generated with Google Nano Banana (Gemini 2.5 Flash Image) and records design decisions for downstream phases.

```

If `docs/ui/nano-banana-explorations.md` already exists, append the new entry with a horizontal rule separator.

### 3. Persist Decision to Project State

Call the MCP `recordDecision` tool/method with the following structure:

**Key**: `ui_concept`

**Value** (object):

```javascript
{
  conceptName: "[The memorable name given to the concept]",
  conceptId: "[Concept identifier from Google AI Studio]",
  selectedDate: "[ISO date string]",
  summary: "[2-3 sentence summary of the concept]",
  colorPalette: ["#hex1", "#hex2", "#hex3"],
  typography: "[Style description]",
  visualStyle: "[Treatment description]",
  aesthetic: "[Adjectives]",
  assetLinks: [
    "path/to/screen-1.png",
    "path/to/screen-2.png"
  ],
  keyDifferentiators: [
    "[Reason 1]",
    "[Reason 2]"
  ],
  implementationNotes: "[Guidance for dev team]"
}
```

**Rationale**: "[Why this concept was chosen - from decision rationale section]"

### 4. Confirm and Guide Next Steps

After logging the selection:

1. **Confirm the recording**:
   - "‚úÖ Concept '[Name]' recorded to project state"
   - "üìù Exploration log updated: docs/ui/nano-banana-explorations.md"

2. **Explain downstream impact**:
   - The frontend architecture will reference this concept
   - UX specifications will include this as the design foundation
   - Development stories will mention the selected visual direction
   - Quick Lane specs will incorporate the concept if available

3. **Recommend next actions**:
   - Proceed to architecture phase (if in Complex Lane workflow)
   - Update UX spec to reference the exploration (if needed)
   - Share the exploration log with the development team
   - Consider creating high-fidelity mockups in Figma/design tool based on selected concept

## Important Notes

- **No Mock Data**: Only record concepts that were actually generated and reviewed by the user
- **Actual Asset Paths**: Require real file paths or URLs, not placeholder references
- **User Decision Required**: Never auto-select a concept; this must be an explicit user choice
- **Single Primary Concept**: Only one concept should be marked as "Selected ‚úÖ" at a time
- **Preserves Alternatives**: Document other concepts as "Considered" for future reference if desired

## Output Artifacts

1. **docs/ui/nano-banana-explorations.md**: Markdown log with visual decision details
2. **Project State Decision**: Persistent record accessible to all downstream agents and Quick Lane
3. **Confirmation Summary**: Clear message to user confirming what was recorded and next steps

## Integration Points

This task is called:

- **Complex Lane**: After UX Expert generates the Nano Banana prompt and user runs it in Google AI Studio
- **Quick Lane**: Can be invoked manually after user generates concepts from the emitted brief
- **Manual Mode**: User can call `@nano-banana-liaison` then `*log-nano-selection` anytime

# Google Nano Banana Visual Concept Prompt

## Canonical Prompt Template

This template contains the canonical prompt structure for Google Nano Banana (Gemini 2.5 Flash Image) visual concept generation. All placeholders should be replaced with actual project context before use.

---

You are Google Nano Banana (Gemini 2.5 Flash Image). Generate {{concept_variations}} distinct visual concepts for {{product_name}}, a {{product_descriptor}} serving {{primary_persona}}.

For each concept, render a cohesive storyboard of four mobile-first screens:

1. Search screen for {{search_goal}}
2. Write/Compose screen for {{write_goal}}
3. Sign Up screen highlighting {{signup_value_prop}}
4. Sign In screen emphasizing {{signin_security_needs}}

Creative constraints:

- Brand cues: {{brand_palette}}, {{typography}}, {{illustration_style}}
- Tone: {{experience_tone}} (ensure consistency across all screens)
- Layout guidance: use {{layout_principles}} with clear hierarchy, accessible contrast, and prominent primary actions
- Include placeholder copy reflecting {{voice_guidelines}}; avoid lorem ipsum
- Maintain component consistency so UI kits can be extracted (buttons, form fields, nav bars, empty states)

Output instructions:

- Deliver each concept as a 4-frame grid (aspect ratio 4:5 per frame) with labels per screen
- Keep backgrounds clean; no watermarks
- After rendering, summarize the differentiators for each concept so stakeholders can pick one

If any required context is missing, assume sensible defaults for a modern SaaS productivity tool and provide helpful clarifying questions.

---

## Placeholder Reference

Replace these placeholders when assembling the final prompt:

### Product Context

- `{{concept_variations}}`: Number of distinct concepts to generate (recommend 3-4)
- `{{product_name}}`: Name of the product (e.g., "TaskFlow", "NoteMate")
- `{{product_descriptor}}`: One-sentence description (e.g., "a collaborative task management tool for remote teams")
- `{{primary_persona}}`: Main user type (e.g., "remote team managers", "freelance designers")

### User Scenarios

- `{{search_goal}}`: What users search/browse for (e.g., "finding project tasks by status or assignee")
- `{{write_goal}}`: What users create/compose (e.g., "creating new tasks with descriptions and due dates")
- `{{signup_value_prop}}`: Key benefit highlighted during onboarding (e.g., "unlimited projects and team collaboration")
- `{{signin_security_needs}}`: Trust/security elements for returning users (e.g., "two-factor authentication and session security")

### Brand & Visual Direction

- `{{brand_palette}}`: Primary and accent colors with hex codes (e.g., "Deep blue #1E3A8A, vibrant orange #F97316, neutral grays")
- `{{typography}}`: Font style direction (e.g., "Modern sans-serif with bold headings and readable body text")
