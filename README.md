**Professional agile workflows through natural conversation. No methodology training required.**

## The Problem

Building software with AI should be simple. Instead, developers waste hours figuring out _how_ to ask AI for help rather than actually building.

Professional teams use structured agile methodologies (analyst ‚Üí PM ‚Üí architect ‚Üí developer ‚Üí QA), but learning these frameworks takes weeks and adds unnecessary friction.

## The Solution

**Agilai gives you professional agile workflows through natural conversation.**

Just talk about your project. The system:

‚úÖ **Understands** what you're building (no framework jargon needed)
‚úÖ **Generates** professional deliverables automatically (PRD, architecture, user stories)
‚úÖ **Guides** you through proven development phases invisibly
‚úÖ **Adapts** to complexity (quick templates vs full workflows)

**You focus on ideas. Agilai handles methodology.**

### Key Features

- **Zero learning curve** - Chat naturally, no methodology training
- **Proven framework** - Built on BMAD-METHOD‚Ñ¢ battle-tested processes
- **Intelligent routing** - Automatically picks right approach for each task
- **Professional output** - Industry-standard documentation
- **Local-first** - Works with Claude CLI, Codex CLI, or OpenCode
- **No API costs** - Runs through your existing CLI tooling

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js ‚â• 20.10.0
- npm ‚â• 9.0.0
- One chat CLI installed: Claude CLI, Codex CLI, or OpenCode CLI

### Installation

```bash
# One command does everything
npx agilai@latest start

# Optional: Specify assistant and provider
npx agilai@latest start --assistant=claude --glm
```

That's it! This command:

1. Creates project structure
2. Installs dependencies
3. Builds MCP server
4. Launches chosen chat interface

## Natural Conversation Example

```
You: "I want to build an app for tracking family chores"

AI: "Great! Let's figure this out together.
     Who will be using this app?"

You: "Parents and kids, ages 8 and up"

AI: "Perfect. What does success look like?"

[... natural conversation continues ...]

AI: "üìã Here's what I understand:
     Project: Family Chore Tracking App
     Users: Parents & children (8+)
     Timeline: 3 months
     Platform: Mobile-first

     Is this correct? (y/n)"
```

Behind the scenes, Agilai generates:

- Project brief (analyst phase)
- Product requirements document (PM phase)
- Technical architecture (architect phase)
- User stories (scrum master phase)
- Implementation guidance (dev phase)

All organized in `docs/` folder, ready to use.

## Extend with Any Tool

Add powerful integrations through natural conversation:

```
You: "I need GitHub integration"

AI: "I can help with that! I'll set up GitHub access.
     What's your GitHub personal access token?"

You: "ghp_****"

AI: "‚úì GitHub integration configured!
     Please restart your chat session for changes to take effect."

[You restart the CLI]

You: "Create an issue for the login bug"

AI: "‚úì Created issue #42: 'Fix login authentication error'"
```

```
You: "I need database access"

AI: "Sure! What database are you using?"

You: "PostgreSQL at localhost"

AI: "‚úì PostgreSQL access configured!
     Restart your chat to start using database features."
```

**Available integrations** (15+): GitHub, PostgreSQL, Filesystem, Puppeteer, Brave Search, Slack, AWS, and more.

## How It Works

```
User: "I want to build an app"
  ‚Üì
[Analyst Phase - Gathers requirements]
  ‚Üì
[PM Phase - Creates development plan]
  ‚Üì
[Architect Phase - Designs technical approach]
  ‚Üì
[Scrum Master Phase - Breaks into stories]
  ‚Üì
[Dev Phase - Guides implementation]
  ‚Üì
[QA Phase - Validates quality]
  ‚Üì
[All phases happen through natural conversation]
```

### Dual-Lane Orchestration

Agilai automatically steers every request through the right mix of speed and depth. You never toggle a switch‚Äîthe system senses complexity and elevates the workflow the moment your project needs more than a quick brief.

**Quick Lane: 3-minute briefs**

The quick lane boots up your `docs/` workspace in minutes, generating the core folders and drafting the product requirement, architecture outline, and user stories you need to get moving. It is designed for lightweight asks where momentum matters most, giving you production-ready assets without waiting on a full committee.

**Complex Lane: BMAD depth on demand**

When scope grows, the complex lane inherits everything the quick lane has already staged and then unleashes the full BMAD multi-agent orchestration. Analysts deepen the research, product managers expand the PRD, architects iterate on design, and delivery experts refine stories‚Äîall while building on the same documentation spine so nothing gets lost in translation.

**Seamless hand-off, consistent outcomes**

Because both lanes converge on the exact same deliverables, you can trust that every project‚Äîsimple or sophisticated‚Äîarrives with the same professional PRD, architecture, and story set. The automatic hand-off means you stay in flow while Agilai keeps your `docs/` assets synchronized and production-ready.
