## Stop Fighting Your Tools. Start Building.

**The Problem:** You have a brilliant idea. But before you write a single line of code, you need:

- A product requirements document (so the team knows what to build)
- Technical architecture (so it's built right)
- Visual design concepts (so it looks professional)
- User stories (so developers know what to implement)

Traditional approach? **Days of writing specs, creating mockups, and coordinating team meetings.**

AI tools today? **Hours of prompt engineering just to get structured output.**

**There has to be a better way.**

## The Agilai Way: Talk Naturally. Ship Professionally.

Imagine describing your project idea in plain English and getting back:

‚ú® **Complete PRD** with user stories, acceptance criteria, and technical requirements
üé® **Visual concept explorations** for every screen in your journey
üèóÔ∏è **Technical architecture** with file structure, tech stack, and implementation guidance
üìã **Development-ready stories** that developers can pick up immediately

**No jargon. No templates. No methodology training.**

Just conversation ‚Üí professional deliverables ‚Üí ready to build.

### How It Works

**1. Quick Lane (Under 5 Minutes)**

- Natural conversation about your idea
- Auto-generated specs, architecture, and visual prompts
- Implementation-ready output in `docs/`

**2. Complex Lane (Enterprise-Grade)**

- Deep-dive conversational discovery
- Visual journey mapping with CSS token extraction
- Multi-phase QA-ready documentation

**3. Conversational UI Designer (NEW üÜï)**

- Guide users through their UI journey step-by-step
- Extract design tokens from reference URLs via Chrome DevTools
- Generate per-screen visual prompts for Google Nano Banana
- Capture decisions with journey context and CSS specifications

### What Makes Agilai Different

üéØ **Zero Prompt Engineering**

> Other tools: "Act as a senior product manager with 10 years experience in SaaS..."
> Agilai: "I want to build a task management app"

üé® **Visual-First Development**

> Traditional: Write specs ‚Üí Hire designer ‚Üí Wait for mockups ‚Üí Start coding
> Agilai: Describe idea ‚Üí Get visual concepts in minutes ‚Üí Architecture adapts automatically

üèÉ **Two Speeds, One System**

> Quick Lane: Ship specs in 5 minutes
> Complex Lane: Enterprise depth when needed
> Seamlessly switch between both

üîí **Local-First, Private**

> No API calls to external services

> **NEW: Conversational UI Designer** - The only AI workflow that guides you through visual discovery the way a real designer would: journey mapping ‚Üí inspiration intake ‚Üí CSS extraction ‚Üí per-screen prompts. [See it in action ‚Üí](#conversational-ui-designer-workflow)

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js ‚â• 20.10.0
- npm ‚â• 9.0.0
- One chat CLI installed: Claude CLI, Codex CLI, or OpenCode CLI

### Installation

```bash
# One command does everything
npx agilai@latest start

# Optional: Specify assistant and provider
npx agilai@latest start --assistant=claude --glm
```

That's it! This command:

1. Creates project structure
2. Installs dependencies
3. Builds MCP server
4. Launches chosen chat interface

‚Üí **[Complete Installation Guide](docs/installation-methods.md)** - All installation options

## Natural Conversation Example

```
You: "I want to build an app for tracking family chores"

AI: "Great! Let's figure this out together.
     Who will be using this app?"

You: "Parents and kids, ages 8 and up"

AI: "Perfect. What does success look like?"

[... natural conversation continues ...]

AI: "üìã Here's what I understand:
     Project: Family Chore Tracking App
     Users: Parents & children (8+)
     Timeline: 3 months
     Platform: Mobile-first

     Is this correct? (y/n)"
```

Behind the scenes, Agilai generates:

- Project brief (analyst phase)
- Product requirements document (PM phase)
- Technical architecture (architect phase)
- User stories (scrum master phase)
- Implementation guidance (dev phase)

All organized in `docs/` folder, ready to use.

## Conversational UI Designer Workflow

**The first AI workflow that designs UIs the way a real designer would: through conversation.**

### üé® How Real Designers Work

1. **Discover the journey** - "Walk me through how users will flow through your app"
2. **Deep-dive each step** - "What's the user's mindset on this screen? What emotion should they feel?"
3. **Gather inspiration** - "Share a reference URL - I'll extract the colors, fonts, and spacing"
4. **Define visual language** - "Let's lock in your palette, typography, and layout system"
5. **Generate concepts** - "Here are tailored prompts for each screen with all the context"

**Agilai's UI Designer Liaison does exactly this.**

### Quick Lane (Auto Mode)

```
You: "I want to build a task management app for remote teams"

AI: "‚úÖ Generated PRD, architecture, and stories
     üìã Quick Lane also created:

     docs/ui/ui-designer-screen-prompts.md

     I've inferred your user journey from the PRD:
     1. Browse tasks
     2. Search & filter
     3. Create task
     4. Task details
     5. Assign & collaborate

     Each screen has a tailored visual concept prompt ready for
     Google Nano Banana (Gemini 2.5 Flash Image).

     Copy the prompts to https://aistudio.google.com and get
     3 concept variations per screen!"
```

**Time:** Under 5 minutes, fully automatic

### Complex Lane (Conversational Mode)

```
You: "@ui-designer-liaison"

Nana: "Hi! I'm Nana, your UI designer liaison. Ready to craft your
       visual journey?

       üé® Existing inspiration (URLs, reference designs)
       ‚ú® From scratch (I'll guide you)
       üîÄ Both

       Which approach works best?"

You: "I have Linear.app as inspiration"

Nana: "Perfect! I notice you want to use Linear.app for reference.

       To automatically extract colors, typography, and CSS tokens,
       I recommend enabling Chrome DevTools MCP. It's optional but
       saves manual work.

       Would you like to activate it?"

You: "Yes, it's enabled"

Nana: "Excellent! Let me extract the visual elements...

       üé® Color Palette:
       - Primary: #5E6AD2 (purple)
       - Accent: #3D9970 (green)
       - Neutral: #6B7280 (gray)

       ‚úçÔ∏è Typography:
       - Headings: 'Inter', sans-serif (600 weight)
       - Body: 'Inter', sans-serif (400 weight)

       üìè Spacing: 4px, 8px, 12px, 16px, 24px, 32px

       What elements should we KEEP vs AVOID from Linear?"

You: "Keep the minimal sidebar and generous spacing. Avoid the complex
      command palette."

Nana: "Got it! Now walk me through your ideal user journey from first
       touch to success..."

[... 6-stage conversational flow continues ...]

Nana: "‚úÖ Visual concept prompts generated!

       üìÑ docs/ui/ui-designer-screen-prompts.md

       5 screens mapped:
       1. Browse tasks
       2. Search & filter
       3. Create task
       4. Task details
       5. Collaborate

       Each prompt includes:
       - Journey context (position, adjacent steps)
       - Persona mindset & goals
       - CSS tokens from Linear.app
       - Your visual preferences

       Copy to Google AI Studio and generate concepts!"
```

**Time:** 10-15 minutes, rich context, CSS extraction

### What You Get

**Per-Screen Prompts** like this:

```
You are Google Nano Banana (Gemini 2.5 Flash Image).
Render 3 concept options for the **Search & Filter** step of TaskFlow Pro.

## Context
- Journey position: Step 2 of 5 (Early exploration phase)
- Previous step: Browse tasks
- Next step: Task details
- Persona mindset: User with specific criteria looking to narrow task list
- Screen goal: Filter tasks by status, assignee, due date efficiently
- Emotional tone: Focused, in-control

## Visual System
### Brand Palette
#5E6AD2, #3D9970, #6B7280

**CSS Tokens:**
--color-primary: #5E6AD2;
--color-accent: #3D9970;
--font-heading: 'Inter', sans-serif;
--space-base: 4px;
--space-md: 12px;

### Typography
- Heading: Inter 600
- Body: Inter 400
- Scale: 14px body, 18px subtitle, 24px heading

[... complete prompt with all context ...]
```

### Chrome MCP Integration

**Extract design tokens from any URL:**

1. Share a reference URL (Linear, Notion, Stripe, etc.)
2. Chrome DevTools MCP automatically captures:
   - Color palette (hex codes)
   - Typography (font families, weights, sizes)
   - Spacing tokens (margins, padding)
   - CSS custom properties
3. Tokens embedded in every screen prompt
4. Developers get CSS-ready specifications

### Log Your Selection

```
You: "*log-selection"

Nana: "Let's record your selected visual concept!

       Which concept did you choose?"

You: "Concept 2 - the clean minimal with purple accents"

Nana: "Perfect! I'll log:
       ‚úÖ Visual characteristics
       ‚úÖ Journey context (5 screens)
       ‚úÖ CSS tokens from Linear.app
       ‚úÖ Per-screen prompts used
       ‚úÖ Asset locations

       Saved to: docs/ui/ui-designer-explorations.md

       This informs:
       - Frontend architecture
       - Component library setup
       - Design system documentation"

### Dual-Lane Orchestration

Agilai automatically steers every request through the right mix of speed and depth. You never toggle a switch‚Äîthe system senses complexity and elevates the workflow the moment your project needs more than a quick brief.

#### Quick Lane: 3-minute briefs

The quick lane boots up your `docs/` workspace in minutes, generating the core folders and drafting the product requirement, architecture outline, user stories, and Google Nano Banana visual concept brief you need to get moving. It is designed for lightweight asks where momentum matters most, giving you production-ready assets without waiting on a full committee.

#### Complex Lane: BMAD depth on demand

When scope grows, the complex lane inherits everything the quick lane has already staged and then unleashes the full BMAD multi-agent orchestration. Analysts deepen the research, product managers expand the PRD, architects iterate on design, and delivery experts refine stories‚Äîall while building on the same documentation spine so nothing gets lost in translation.

#### Seamless hand-off, consistent outcomes

Because both lanes converge on the exact same deliverables, you can trust that every project‚Äîsimple or sophisticated‚Äîarrives with the same professional PRD, architecture, and story set. The automatic hand-off means you stay in flow while Agilai keeps your `docs/` assets synchronized and production-ready.

    ComplexLane --> Docs
```

**Summary:** The Quick Lane runtime sequentially loads the Spec Kit‚Äìderived spec, plan, and tasks templates‚Äîcalling the LLM at each step to author `docs/prd.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, and `docs/stories/*.md`‚Äîwhile the Complex lane employs the multi-agent BMAD workflow to produce the same deliverables through coordinated specialists.
