# Conversational UI Designer Validation Report

## Evaluation Approach

- Reviewed the complete UI designer liaison workflow in `aidesigner-core/tasks/discover-ui-journey.md`, `aidesigner-core/tasks/generate-ui-designer-prompt.md`, and `aidesigner-core/tasks/record-ui-designer-selection.md` to ensure the staged dialogue captures all required state before prompt generation.
- Cross-referenced the canonical per-screen prompt template in `aidesigner-core/templates/ui-designer-screen-prompt.md` to confirm every placeholder is satisfied by the discovery flow or has a safe fallback.
- Simulated three representative conversations end-to-end using the liaison command set (`*discover-journey`, `*assemble-prompts`, `*log-selection`) to trace how data moves between stages and identify potential breakpoints.

## Scenario Coverage

### 1. Inspiration-First with Chrome MCP Enabled

1. User selects the inspiration path during Stage 0 warm-up (`flowMode = "inspiration"`).
2. During Stage 3 the liaison offers Chrome DevTools MCP, navigates to the shared URL, and captures colors, typography, and spacing tokens.
3. The extracted evidence populates `referenceAssets[]` and feeds into the visual system synthesis step in `*assemble-prompts`.
4. Generated prompts show concrete CSS variables sourced from MCP artifacts and high-confidence evidence trail entries.

**Observations:**

- Chrome MCP prompts include clear follow-up to capture keep/avoid notes so blended evidence stays grounded.
- Evidence trail objects make it into the per-screen prompt template, enabling downstream auditing of visual decisions.

### 2. Inspiration-First without Chrome MCP

1. User still chooses inspiration, but declines MCP setup or does not have it installed.
2. Stage 3 falls back to manual elicitation of palettes, typography, and layout elements for each reference.
3. Defaults in `*assemble-prompts` resolve missing CSS variables while retaining manually captured intent.
4. Confidence notes flag the lower certainty so developers know when tokens were inferred.

**Observations:**

- Manual capture keeps parity with MCP output because the prompt template accepts descriptive values in place of CSS variables.
- No hard dependency on Chrome MCP; liaison gracefully continues with descriptive data.

### 3. From-Scratch Visual System

1. User selects the scratch path in Stage 0 (`flowMode = "scratch"`).
2. Stage 3 is skipped in favor of Stage 4 defaults, where the liaison proposes a modern SaaS palette, typography, and layout.
3. User customises the suggested palette/typography; those updates populate the discovery state directly.
4. Generated prompts rely entirely on Stage 4 data plus the step-specific requirements captured in Stage 2.

**Observations:**

- Stage 4 confirmation loop is sufficient to provide every token required by the prompt template even without external references.
- Accessibility and voice guidance fall back to sensible defaults while still allowing per-step overrides when specified.

## Potential Failure Points Identified

| Area                    | Risk                                                                                                                                 | Mitigation                                                                                                                                                   |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Stage 3 gating          | The original instruction said “If `flowMode` includes `"inspiration"`”, which skipped Stage 3 when the user chose the "both" option. | Updated to explicitly treat `flowMode === "inspiration" \|\| flowMode === "both"`, ensuring inspiration capture runs for the mixed path.                     |
| Evidence availability   | Quick Lane prompts may reference Chrome MCP artifacts that are not present.                                                          | Prompt assembly already checks `chromeMcpEvidence` before falling back; ensure Quick Lane surfaces warning copy if no evidence remains (future enhancement). |
| Accessibility overrides | Accessibility/touch target/voice settings rely on defaults when users do not specify overrides.                                      | Defaults remain WCAG AA compliant; liaison can optionally elicit overrides during Stage 2 future iteration.                                                  |

## Conclusions

- After the Stage 3 gating fix, the liaison successfully handles inspiration-first, mixed, and scratch workflows without blocking progression.
- Chrome MCP integration is optional but provides higher-confidence CSS tokens when available.
- Remaining opportunities are iterative (e.g., richer accessibility elicitation) rather than blockers for the conversational workflow.
