# Quick Designer v4 - AI-Driven UI Generation System

## 🚀 Overview

Quick Designer v4 is a revolutionary AI-driven UI generation system that replaces static templates with dynamic, intelligent design creation. The system learns from any website, image, or description to generate unique, production-ready UIs.

## 🌟 Key Features

### 1. **Multi-Source Design Extraction**

- **URLs**: Extract design systems from any website
- **Images**: Analyze screenshots to capture design patterns
- **Descriptions**: Generate from natural language descriptions

### 2. **Interactive Workflow**

- Conversational design process
- Real-time feedback and refinement
- Progressive page building

### 3. **Design System Fusion**

- Merge multiple design sources
- Weighted combination (e.g., "60% Stripe + 40% Airbnb")
- Intelligent pattern synthesis

### 4. **AI-Powered Generation**

- No static templates
- Dynamic HTML generation
- Infinite variations possible

## 🔧 Usage Examples

### Start Interactive Session

```javascript
// Initialize workflow
const workflow = new DesignWorkflow();

// Process user input
const response = await workflow.processUserInput('Create a SaaS dashboard inspired by Linear');

// Continue conversation
const refined = await workflow.processUserInput("Add Stripe's color scheme");

// Export result
const html = workflow.exportPages('html');
```

### Extract Design from URL

```javascript
const extracted = await extractFromURL('https://stripe.com');
// Returns: { designSpec, components, metadata }
```

### Generate UI with AI

```javascript
const html = await generateUIFromDesignSystem(
  {
    screenType: 'dashboard',
    designSpec: extractedDesign,
    variation: 'modern',
  },
  aiService,
);
```

### Merge Design Systems

```javascript
const merged = mergeDesignSystems([
  { design: stripeDesign, weight: 0.6 },
  { design: airbnbDesign, weight: 0.4 },
]);
```

## 🚦 Workflow States

1. **INITIAL_BRIEF**: Gathering requirements
2. **COLLECTING_REFERENCES**: Adding design sources
3. **ANALYZING_DESIGN**: Processing references
4. **GENERATING_VARIANTS**: Creating options
5. **REFINING_OUTPUT**: Applying feedback
6. **BUILDING_PAGES**: Adding screens
7. **EXPORT_READY**: Ready for export

## 📝 Example Conversation Flow

```
User: "I like Airbnb's navigation"
→ System extracts Airbnb navigation design

User: "Mix with Stripe's colors"
→ System merges design systems

User: "Generate login page"
→ AI creates login with merged design

User: "Make it darker"
→ System applies feedback

User: "Add dashboard"
→ System generates matching dashboard

User: "Export as HTML"
→ System exports complete UI
```
