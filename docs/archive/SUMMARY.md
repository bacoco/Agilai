# Implementation Summary - Agilai-invisible (Historical)

> **⚠️ HISTORICAL DOCUMENT**: This file describes the early prototype phase from 2024. The initiative was originally branded **BMAD-invisible** and is now shipped as **Agilai-invisible**. Command names and branding below have been updated to the current terminology, with legacy aliases noted where helpful. See README.md and DUAL_LANE_ORCHESTRATION.md for current status.

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Code Examination ✓

- Analyzed invisible orchestrator implementation
- Examined agents, commands, hooks, and MCP server
- Identified 8 auto-commands for each Agilai phase
- Reviewed phase detection and transition logic

### 2. Implementation Assessment ✓

- **Works**: Conceptual design, agent structure, safety patterns
- **Needs Work**: LLM integration, Agilai core connection, CLI interface
- **Critical Issue**: MCP SDK dependency (was `^agilai.1.agilai`, now `^1.18.2`)

### 3. Documentation Created ✓

#### Historical Analysis (Removed)

This file documented the early prototype stage and has been removed as the project is now production-ready. See DUAL_LANE_ORCHESTRATION.md for current architecture.

#### README.md (Updated - 512 lines)

Complete overhaul with:

- Clear "What is Agilai-invisible" explanation
- Quick start guide
- Traditional Agilai vs Agilai-invisible comparison
- Visual architecture diagram
- Complete 8-phase workflow table
- Full end-to-end example (Family Chore App)
- Second example (Adding features to existing project)
- Current implementation status
- Architecture details
- Development setup instructions
- Vision for ideal UX
- Roadmap to production

### 4. Dependencies Fixed ✓

- Updated `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` from `^agilai.1.agilai` to `^1.18.2`
- All other dependencies already correct

### 5. Code Pushed ✓

- All changes committed and pushed to `main` branch
- Latest commit: `49a8b22 - docs: add comprehensive analysis and improve README`

## 📊 Analysis Results

### Is It Working?

**No - This is a prototype.** The conceptual design is solid, but it needs:

1. CLI chat interface
2. LLM client integration (Claude/GPT/Gemini)
3. Connection to actual Agilai core agents
4. Deliverable generation (PRD, architecture docs)
5. User validation checkpoints

### Can We Improve It?

**Yes! Significant improvements needed:**

#### Priority 1 (Functional)

- Build CLI chat interface (`cli/invisible-chat.js`)
- Create Agilai integration bridge (historically `lib/bmad-bridge.js`)
- Implement LLM client (`lib/llm-client.js`)
- Add deliverable generation to `docs/` folder

#### Priority 2 (UX)

- Add user validation after each phase
- Implement iterative refinement
- Create progress indicators
- Add rollback capability

#### Priority 3 (Polish)

- Comprehensive examples
- Error handling
- Performance optimization
- Testing

### Is This the Best Way?

**The approach is good, but needs refinement:**

✅ **Good Decisions:**

- Invisible phase detection
- Natural conversation flow
- Integration with Agilai core
- User validation checkpoints
- MCP for state persistence

⚠️ **Needs Improvement:**

- Current auto-commands are just markdown, should invoke real Agilai agents
- Missing LLM integration layer
- No actual CLI interface
- Hooks have stub functions
- Missing file I/O for deliverables

### Are Users Solicited to Validate?

**Currently no, but should be! Recommended checkpoints:**

1. **After Analyst Phase**

   ```
   "Here's what I understand about your project... [summary]"
   "Does this look correct? (y/n/edit)"
   ```

2. **After PM Phase**

   ```
   "I've created a development plan... [shows timeline & milestones]"
   "Shall I proceed with technical architecture? (y/n)"
   ```

3. **After Architect Phase**

   ```
   "Here's the recommended technical approach... [shows stack]"
   "Does this work for you? (y/n/modify)"
   ```

4. **After Story Creation**

   ```
   "Ready to start building Story 1.1? (y/n/details)"
   ```

5. **After Each Story**
   ```
   "Story complete! Ready for the next one? (y/review/pause)"
   ```

## 🎯 How to Make It Work Like Agilai

### Required Integration

```javascript
// Instead of auto-analyze.md just having text:
const agilai = require('./agilai-bridge');

async function runAnalystPhase(context) {
  // Use actual Agilai analyst agent
  const brief = await agilai.runAgent('analyst', {
    task: 'facilitate-brainstorming-session',
    context: context.conversation,
  });

  // Generate actual document
  await agilai.generateDocument('docs/brief.md', brief);

  return brief;
}
```

### NPX Usage Should Be:

```bash
# Like Agilai
npx agilai-method install    # Install Agilai framework
npx agilai-method flatten    # Flatten codebase

# Agilai-invisible should be
npx agilai chat            # Start conversation
npx agilai init            # Initialize project
npx agilai status          # Show current phase
npx agilai continue        # Resume conversation
# Legacy note: `bmad-*` command aliases continue to work for returning teams.
```

### Chat Interface Example

```javascript
// cli/invisible-chat.js
const readline = require('readline');
const { runInvisibleOrchestrator } = require('../lib/orchestrator');

async function chat() {
  const rl = readline.createInterface({
    input: process.stdin,
    output: process.stdout,
  });

  let context = await loadProjectState();

  while (true) {
    const userInput = await askQuestion(rl, '> ');

    if (userInput === 'exit') break;

    // Process with invisible orchestrator
    const response = await runInvisibleOrchestrator(userInput, context);

    console.log('\n' + response.message + '\n');

    // Save state
    context = response.context;
    await saveProjectState(context);
  }
}
```

## 📈 Next Steps

### Immediate (Week 1-2)

1. ✅ Documentation complete
2. ⏭️ Fix dependencies (`npm install` should work)
3. ⏭️ Build CLI chat interface
4. ⏭️ Create LLM client
5. ⏭️ Implement Agilai bridge (legacy alias: BMAD bridge)

### Short Term (Week 3-4)

6. Connect to actual Agilai agents
7. Generate real deliverables (PRD, architecture)
8. Add user validation checkpoints
9. File I/O to `docs/` folder

### Medium Term (Week 5-8)

1agilai. Comprehensive testing 11. Error handling 12. Polish conversation flow 13. Community feedback 14. Release v1.agilai

## 🎉 Summary
