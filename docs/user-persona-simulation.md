# Scenario Overview

- **Persona**: _Maya Chen_, 33-year-old freelance UX researcher and product strategist.
- **Goal**: Prototype a personalized mindfulness companion app for busy remote workers in under two hours.
- **Environment**: Maya uses the AiDesigner web interface on a laptop, backed by the invisible orchestrator coordinating planning, research, and UI agents.
- **Success Criteria**:
  - A validated product direction and interaction flow.
  - A prompt Maya can reuse with Gemini (or any LLM-based UI generator) to create high-fidelity mockups.
  - Confidence that orchestrated agents responded correctly at each phase.

# Stage 0 ‚Äì Idea Intake

| Actor            | Action                                                                                                               | System Notes                                                                 |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Maya             | Enters natural-language brief: _‚ÄúI want a mindfulness companion that fits micro-breaks into a remote worker‚Äôs day.‚Äù_ | Invisible Orchestrator logs a new session, routes message to Phase Detector. |
| Phase Detector   | Classifies phase as `Discovery/Problem Framing`.                                                                     | Confidence score 0.81 triggers Research Planner agent.                       |
| Research Planner | Requests clarifying intents: target habits, metrics for success.                                                     | Prompts are bundled and returned to Maya.                                    |

**Verification**: Phase detection aligns with discovery cues (goal, context). Planner prompts are contextual and avoid implementation bias.

# Stage 1 ‚Äì Clarifying Dialogues

## Round 1

- **Maya**: ‚ÄúFocus on remote designers, help them decompress in 5-minute intervals, and track mood trends.‚Äù
- **Planner Agent**: Summarizes constraints, requests data sources (journaling, wearables) and tone preferences.
- **Invisible Orchestrator**: Confirms requirements completeness (coverage score 0.74 < 0.8 threshold) ‚Üí requests further detail.

## Round 2

- **Maya**: ‚ÄúNo wearables. Use calendar and Slack to spot breaks. Tone should feel like a calm colleague.‚Äù
- **Planner Agent**: Recomputes coverage score (0.88). Triggers transition to `Concept Exploration` lane.
- **System Check**: Handoff handshake logged; UI displays ‚ÄúDiscovery Complete ‚úì‚Äù.

**Verification**: Requirements coverage metric increased after additional detail. Lane switch occurs once threshold met.

# Stage 2 ‚Äì Concept Synthesis

| Step | Responsible Agent            | Output                                                                    | QA                                                               |
| ---- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Concept Synthesizer          | Drafts user journey (trigger ‚Üí micro-coaching ‚Üí reflection).              | Cross-checked with context slots; no missing persona attributes. |
| 2    | Ritual Library (domain pack) | Suggests 3 micro-exercises (box breathing, desk stretch, gratitude ping). | Exercises comply with ‚Äúno wearables‚Äù constraint.                 |
| 3    | UX Writer                    | Crafts notification copy in ‚Äúcalm colleague‚Äù tone.                        | Tone analysis score 0.92 (target ‚â• 0.9).                         |
| 4    | Orchestrator                 | Bundles outputs into `Concept Packet v1`.                                 | Packet validated, passed to Maya via UI.                         |

# Stage 3 ‚Äì Conversational Review

**Maya**: Requests assurance about data privacy and analytics transparency.

**Trust & Compliance Agent**:

- Produces privacy stance summary.
- Suggests transparent consent flow and anonymized mood analytics.
- Flags need for legal review before launch.

**Verification**: Compliance agent triggered because conversation touched on data governance keywords; ensures coverage before build handoff.

# Stage 4 ‚Äì UI Exploration Prompt

The system now prepares a Gemini-ready prompt derived from the validated concept packet.

```text
You are Gemini, acting as a senior product designer. Create three high-fidelity mobile screens for a ‚ÄúQuiet Quarters‚Äù mindfulness companion targeting remote product designers.

Context:
- Sessions last 5 minutes, inserted between calendar gaps or after Slack focus sessions.
- Interface tone: calm colleague, warm neutrals with subtle gradients.
- Key screens: (1) Home dashboard with upcoming micro-break prompt, (2) Active session with animated breathing coach and skip/reschedule controls, (3) Reflection screen showing mood trend chart for the week.
- Integrations: Google Calendar read access, Slack status detection. No wearable data.
- Accessibility: large tap targets, optional voice guidance toggle, WCAG AA contrast.

Deliverables:
- Component list and layout rationale.
- Microcopy for notifications and empty states.
- Suggestions for motion design to reinforce calmness.
```

**Verification**: Prompt automatically assembled by Prompt Composer agent; cross-references all persona constraints. System confirms Gemini prompt coverage checklist (persona, tone, screens, accessibility, integrations) = 5/5.

# Stage 5 ‚Äì Low-Fidelity Maquette

Using the `Concept Packet v1`, AiDesigner‚Äôs Wireframe Drafting agent returns an ASCII maquette that Maya can refine:

```
+--------------------------------------------------+
| Quiet Quarters                                    |
| 08:55 next pause in 5m ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúPrep your mind for UX review‚Äù
|--------------------------------------------------|
| [Take 5 Now]    [Snooze 10]                      |

| Mood trend this week                              |
|  Mon  Tue  Wed  Thu  Fri                         |
|   üôÇ    üôÇ    üòê    üôÇ    üòÄ                      |
|--------------------------------------------------|
| Tip of the day: Box breathing with visual timer  |
+--------------------------------------------------+
```

```
+------------------------------+
| Breathe with Cole (2:45 left)|

|  Hold ‚ñ∏‚ñ∏‚ñ∏                   |
|  Exhale ‚ñ∏‚ñ∏‚ñ∏                 |
|------------------------------|
|  [Pause]    [Skip]   [Voice ‚úì]|
+------------------------------+
```

```
+----------------------------------------+
| How did the breaks help today?         |
|----------------------------------------|
| Mood slider: üòü ---‚óâ---- üòÄ             |
| Notes field: ‚ÄúWhat made the biggest diff?‚Äù|
|----------------------------------------|
| Trend insight: ‚ÄúEvening breaks improved |
| focus by 18% week-over-week.‚Äù          |
|----------------------------------------|
| [Share summary]    [Schedule tomorrow] |
+----------------------------------------+
```

**Verification**: Wireframe adheres to stated requirements (no wearable references, calm copy, accessible controls). QA checklist marks `Layout`, `Tone`, and `Accessibility` as pass; `Visual polish` intentionally pending.

# Stage 6 ‚Äì Wrap-Up & Next Steps

1. **Session Summary**: Orchestrator compiles transcript, decisions, outstanding risks (legal review) into a downloadable brief.
2. **Handoff Guidance**: Suggests running the Gemini prompt plus maquette through a design tool (Figma) and scheduling stakeholder review.
3. **Retro Capture**: Maya leaves feedback; satisfaction score 4.5/5 stored for model fine-tuning.

# Key Takeaways

- The simulation validates multi-agent collaboration from idea capture through UI artifacts.
- Automated metrics (phase confidence, coverage, tone analysis) show the guardrails functioning.
- Deliverables (Gemini prompt, ASCII maquette) equip the persona to continue in her preferred tools without manual rewriting.
