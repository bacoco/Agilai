## Project Idea Summary

Maya wants a contextual budgeting coach embedded in the existing banking app. The assistant should:

- Help users set spending goals tied to categories.
- Provide real-time insights based on transaction history.
- Offer proactive tips when the user is close to overspending.
- Surface compliance-friendly language with optional disclosures.

## Simulation Goals

1. Validate that AiDesigner orchestrates the correct agents for discovery, UX planning, and compliance checks.
2. Ensure the conversation remains natural-language only and delivers artifacts without code-level intervention.
3. Produce Gemini-ready prompts for UI generation along with a maquette outline the design team can hand off to stakeholders.

## Interaction Timeline

The following transcript shows a condensed but complete interaction between Maya and the invisible orchestrator. Each step lists the orchestrated agents and outcomes to verify correct behavior.

### Phase 1: Idea Capture & Alignment

**Conversation Excerpt**

> **Maya:** I need a budgeting coach inside our banking app that helps users stick to their spending goals.
>
> **Orchestrator:** Got it. Who are we targeting and what outcome matters most?
>
> **Maya:** Young professionals who already use our app. We want them to feel confident that the app proactively protects their budget.
>
> **Orchestrator:** Understood. I’ll run discovery to map outcomes, constraints, and potential risks.

**Agents Activated**

- `phase-detector` identifies discovery lane.
- `ux-discovery-analyst` gathers audience needs and success metrics.
- `compliance-audit-lite` flags regulatory keywords (e.g., disclosures, opt-in tracking).

**Outputs**

- Discovery brief with primary persona, pains, and success metrics.
- Risk log noting financial compliance prompts and opt-in consent requirement.

### Phase 2: Experience Mapping & Flow Draft

**Conversation Excerpt**

> **Orchestrator:** Here’s what we know: users want proactive alerts, guidance, and reassurance. Shall I sketch the flow?
>
> **Maya:** Yes, focus on the budgeting coach touchpoints and make sure we include compliance callouts.
>
> **Orchestrator:** Mapping the journey now.

**Agents Activated**

- `journey-mapper` builds step-by-step interaction flow.
- `copy-strategist` drafts coaching tone and microcopy.
- `compliance-audit-lite` re-checks flagged touchpoints.

**Outputs**

- Journey map covering onboarding, goal setup, monitoring, and review loops.
- Microcopy suggestions for coach messages with inline disclosures.
- Compliance checklist cross-referencing regulatory requirements.

### Phase 3: UI Structure & Component Planning

**Conversation Excerpt**

> **Orchestrator:** I can propose UI modules next: dashboard cards, goal trackers, and alert modals. Anything to add?
>
> **Maya:** Include personalized insights and a quick action area. Keep it in our fintech visual language.
>
> **Orchestrator:** Understood. Generating structure with style guardrails.

**Agents Activated**

- `ui-architect` defines layout regions and component hierarchy.
- `design-system-guardian` maps modules to existing design tokens.
- `data-visualization-advisor` ensures charts and alerts convey financial status clearly.

**Outputs**

- Screen blueprint for home dashboard, goal setup wizard, and alert modal.
- Component inventory mapped to design system primitives.
- Data visualization guidelines highlighting safe ranges and warning thresholds.

### Phase 4: Validation & Handoff Packaging

**Conversation Excerpt**

> **Orchestrator:** We’re ready to package prompts and a maquette brief. Want me to summarize key decisions?
>
> **Maya:** Yes, please include the user flow, tone, and compliance guardrails so I can brief the UI designer.
>
> **Orchestrator:** Compiling the bundle now.

**Agents Activated**

- `handoff-packager` assembles deliverables.
- `qa-sanity-checker` validates completeness against success criteria.
- `compliance-audit-lite` performs final sweep.

**Outputs**

- Gemini prompt for UI generation.
- Mid-fidelity maquette outline with interaction notes.
- Final validation report confirming persona goals are met.

## Gemini UI Prompt

Below is the polished prompt Maya copies directly into Gemini to request UI compositions:

```
Design a fintech mobile interface for "Budget Coach" inside an existing banking app.
Context: Young professionals want proactive budgeting support with compliance-friendly language.
Screens needed:
1. Home dashboard card summarizing monthly spending vs. goal with an encouraging coach message.
2. Goal setup wizard with category selection, smart suggestions, and disclosure footer.
3. Alert modal that triggers when spending nears the limit, offering quick actions (adjust goal, review tips).
Tone: Supportive, trustworthy, uses concise fintech copy. Visual style should align with modern banking apps (clean typography, muted blues/teals, clear data viz with safe and warning states).
Accessibility: Ensure high contrast, tap targets >= 44px, and screen reader labels for financial figures.
Compliance: Include opt-in confirmation and disclosure footers on relevant screens.
Deliver outputs as 3 screen mockups with consistent component spacing.
```

## Maquette Outline for the Design Team

1. **Overview Slide**
   - Title: "Budget Coach Prototype"
   - Key insight: proactive support reduces anxiety for budgeting users.
   - Persona reminder: Maya’s young professional segment.
2. **Screen 1: Home Dashboard Card**
   - Layout: Card within existing dashboard grid.
   - Modules: Spending gauge, coach message, quick actions.

3. **Screen 2: Goal Setup Wizard**
   - Layout: Full-screen modal with progress indicator.
   - Steps: Select categories, set limits, confirm disclosures.
   - Notes: Inline helper text from copy strategist.
4. **Screen 3: Alert Modal**
   - Layout: Centered modal with traffic-light visual.
   - Modules: Warning badge, contextual tip, "Adjust goal" primary button.
   - Notes: Ensure accessible contrast and compliance footnotes.
5. **Interaction Flow Summary**
   - Table listing triggers, system responses, and follow-up actions.
   - Highlight compliance checkpoints and analytics hooks.
6. **Next Steps**
   - Schedule usability test with 5 target users.
   - Collect analytics requirements for engineering handoff.

## Verification Checklist
