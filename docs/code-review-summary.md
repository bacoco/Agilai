# Codebase Review Summary

## Repository Structure

- **CLI & utilities**: The `bin/` and `common/` directories host the Node-based CLI entrypoint and supporting helpers for environment parsing, provider resolution, and process spawning. 【F:bin/aidesigner†L1-L188】【F:common/utils/assistant-env.js†L1-L160】
- **Core knowledge base**: The `aidesigner-core/` tree captures markdown definitions for agents, workflows, templates, and reusable checklists that drive the orchestration layer. 【F:aidesigner-core/agents/dev.md†L1-L80】
- **Typed packages**: Multiple packages under `packages/` (e.g., `inference`, `codegen`, `shared-types`) provide TypeScript implementations for token inference, component detection, and downstream code generation. 【F:packages/inference/src/tokens.ts†L1-L36】【F:packages/codegen/src/react-shadcn.ts†L1-L25】【F:packages/shared-types/src/index.ts†L1-L34】

## Strengths Observed

- **Defensive CLI ergonomics**: The CLI resolves provider configuration from CLI args, environment variables, or `.env` files, and includes validation such as newline checks to prevent malformed env entries, improving usability and resilience. 【F:bin/aidesigner†L38-L148】
- **Security-minded codegen**: `buildShadcnPage` resolves and validates the output directory to guard against path traversal before writing generated assets. 【F:packages/codegen/src/react-shadcn.ts†L5-L24】
- **Shared schema discipline**: Centralized types for tokens, component maps, evidence packs, and validation reports encourage consistency across inference and generation subsystems. 【F:packages/shared-types/src/index.ts†L1-L34】

## Risks & Opportunities

- **Placeholder inference logic**: Both `inferTokens` and `detectComponents` currently return hard-coded heuristics while TODO comments outline the intended algorithms, signalling that production accuracy will require significant implementation work. 【F:packages/inference/src/tokens.ts†L8-L35】【F:packages/inference/src/components.ts†L3-L34】
- **Unused parameters**: `buildShadcnPage` accepts a `comps` argument that is never consumed, which could be removed or integrated to apply component mappings during generation. 【F:packages/codegen/src/react-shadcn.ts†L5-L24】
- **Limited validation feedback loop**: The repository defines types for validation and evidence packs but lacks concrete wiring within the current packages, suggesting an opportunity to surface QA metrics end-to-end.

## Suggested Next Steps

1. Implement the outlined clustering and pattern-detection logic in the inference package to move beyond stubbed outputs. 【F:packages/inference/src/tokens.ts†L8-L35】【F:packages/inference/src/components.ts†L3-L34】
2. Extend `buildShadcnPage` to leverage the provided component map, allowing generated pages to adapt to detected variants and states. 【F:packages/codegen/src/react-shadcn.ts†L5-L24】
3. Wire validation reporting from the inference outputs through to any CLI or reporting surface so that teams can act on QA findings defined in shared types. 【F:packages/shared-types/src/index.ts†L20-L34】
